# YouTube Subtitle Search:
Search for words in YouTube videos via subtitles.

## Description:
Imagine as a video editor you are tasked with creating a video montage of sorts. This montage requires you to combine clips in which every clip features the same keyword. For example, think of the viral Owen Wilson meme. YouTube Subtitle Search, given a source file of links, allows you to search through all these YouTube videos for your desired clip, verify if it exists, and gives you the option to download the video at that interval only.
